# Post-install (Ubuntu / Raspberry Pi OS)

[`work/scripts/post-install.sh`](../work/scripts/post-install.sh) prepares a fresh Ubuntu or Raspberry Pi OS
install for the Ktemata build.

```bash
sudo ./work/scripts/post-install.sh                  # update, install Kiwix, enable the service
sudo ./work/scripts/post-install.sh --rotate left    # + turn the Touch Display 2 90° left
sudo ./work/scripts/post-install.sh --sample         # + fetch one small ZIM to test with
./work/scripts/post-install.sh --dry-run             # show the commands, change nothing
```

Inspired by [`after-effects`](https://github.com/tprasadtp/ubuntu-post-install) but deliberately small: one
file, no YAML config, no whiptail menu. Idempotent — safe to re-run.

## What it does, in order

| Step | Action | Flag |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Platform check: Debian/Ubuntu derivative, warns on untested arch | — |
| 2 | **System update**: `apt-get update` then a non-interactive `full-upgrade` (keeps existing conffiles) | `--no-update` |
| 3 | Install `kiwix-tools`, `curl`, `ca-certificates`, the `kiwix` desktop app | `--no-gui` |
| 4 | Create `/srv/kiwix/zim` and the `kiwix` system user | — |
| 5 | Write and enable `kiwix.service` (`kiwix-serve` on :8080) | `--no-service` |
| 6 | Set the display rotation | `--rotate left\|right\|inverted\|normal` |
| 7 | Optionally download a sample ZIM and confirm the server answers | `--sample` |

The update runs **first** so the later package install needs no second upgrade pass, and a fresh image does
not get a Kiwix build that is already superseded.

## Display rotation

The Touch Display 2 is **720 × 1280 natively (portrait)**; the r4 case mounts it in landscape, so a new
install usually needs a rotation.

`--rotate left` means **90° counter-clockwise** (what "turn the screen left" means to a person). The kernel
takes clockwise degrees, so the script maps it:

| You ask for | Kernel value | Screen result |
|---|---|---|
| `left` | `rotate=270` | 90° counter-clockwise |
| `right` | `rotate=90` | 90° clockwise |
| `inverted` | `rotate=180` | upside down |
| `normal` | `rotate=0` | native portrait |

Two separate things are rotated, because on Raspberry Pi OS they are separate:

1. **Console / kiosk** — one line in `/boot/firmware/cmdline.txt`:

   ```
   video=DSI-1:720x1280@60,rotate=270
   ```

   The script appends it, or rewrites an existing `video=DSI-1:…` entry in place, and keeps a
   `cmdline.txt.ktemata.bak`. Running it again is a no-op.
2. **Desktop session** — `wlr-randr --output <DSI-1> --transform <90|180|270|normal>`. This is per session,
   so after a reboot use *Preferences → Screen Configuration → DSI-1 → Orientation*, or re-run with
   `--rotate`.

Notes:

* Only the **text console** follows `rotate=`; apps that write straight to DRM (VLC, libcamera) need their
  own rotation option.
* With **multiple displays**, `cmdline.txt` rotates all of them — use the desktop tool instead.
* On a non-Pi Ubuntu box there is no `/boot/firmware/cmdline.txt`; the step logs and moves on.
* Rotation is per display, not per case: if you print a different face the display sits in, change it.

## kiwix-serve

The unit runs as the unprivileged `kiwix` user and is hardened (`NoNewPrivileges`, `ProtectSystem=strict`,
read-only library). It carries

```
ConditionPathExistsGlob=/srv/kiwix/zim/*.zim
```

so on a fresh install with an empty library it stays inactive instead of failing in a restart loop. Drop ZIMs
in and `systemctl restart kiwix`.

The service user must be able to read the archives, so the script sets the library group to `kiwix` with
`g+rX` — and repeats that after the `--sample` download, which otherwise lands `root:root` and is invisible
to the service.

```bash
systemctl status kiwix
journalctl -u kiwix -f
curl -sI http://localhost:8080/ | head -1
```

Override the location with `--zim-dir` and the port with `--port`; both are also honoured in the unit.

## Where the ZIMs come from

<https://download.kiwix.org/zim/> — the same library the device itself carries (see [`../zim/zim.md`](../zim/zim.md)).
The `--sample` download is `wikiciv_en_all_maxi_2025-11.zim` (4.4 MB, civil-defence wiki), small enough to
fetch on a metered link. Override with `SAMPLE_ZIM=…`.

Mind the disk: the full English Wikipedia `maxi` archive is ~119 GB, Gutenberg `mul_all` ~254 GB.

## Options and environment

```text
-y, --yes              no confirmation prompt
-n, --dry-run          print commands, run nothing (no root needed)
    --sample           download one small ZIM
    --zim-dir DIR      library directory (default /srv/kiwix/zim)
    --port PORT        kiwix-serve port (default 8080)
    --no-service       packages only
    --no-gui           skip the desktop app
    --no-update        skip the system upgrade
    --rotate WHAT      normal | left | right | inverted (or 0|90|180|270 clockwise)
-h, --help / -V, --version
```

`ZIM_DIR`, `SERVICE_PORT`, `SERVICE_USER`, `SAMPLE_ZIM`, `ROTATE`, `NO_COLOR` and `CMDLINE_FILE` (test hook)
can be set in the environment.

## Verified

Run inside `ubuntu:24.04` (amd64): dry run, then a real install with `--yes --sample --no-gui`. `kiwix-tools
3.5.0` installed, the sample ZIM downloaded, and a throwaway `kiwix-serve` answered on :9080. On the host
(Arch) the platform check correctly refuses. A re-run is idempotent ("already exists", "already the newest
version"), the generated unit was inspected, and the service user was confirmed able to read the archive
(`head -c4` returns the `ZIM\x04` magic).

Rotation was exercised against synthetic `cmdline.txt` copies: append to a file without a trailing newline,
replace an existing `rotate=0`, and a repeat run reporting "already set".

Not covered: arm64 was checked only at the package level (Ubuntu publishes `kiwix`, `kiwix-tools` and
`zim-tools` for arm64 in noble), and the desktop `wlr-randr` path has not been run on real Wayland hardware.
